# PixelMe
A personal project expanding on the progress made in a friday group-project. Idea originally devised by Victoria, Rodrigo, Callum and myself. It is a paint-by-numbers inspired pixel art web-application that aims to allow users to save their own pixel art and use it as a template for others to complete.
